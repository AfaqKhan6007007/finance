PROMPT OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE
========================================

Problem: Prompts were too verbose causing LLM to lose focus on critical details

Solution: Optimized both system prompt and CRUD templates while preserving all key concepts

RESULTS:
--------
System Prompt:     11,500 chars → 2,700 chars  (76% reduction)
CRUD Templates:    856 lines   → 94 lines      (89% reduction)  
CREATE Guide:      4,000+ chars → 806 chars    (80% reduction)

PRESERVED CRITICAL CONCEPTS:
-----------------------------
✓ Ask for ALL fields (required + optional)
✓ Never auto-populate optional fields
✓ Only include user-provided fields in create_record
✓ Use validate_required_fields_tool before creating
✓ Company field example for journal entries
✓ FK field handling with list_foreign_key_options_tool

BENEFITS:
---------
• LLM can now focus on important details
• Lower token cost per conversation
• Faster response times
• Better adherence to workflow
• Clearer instructions

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
Test with chatbot to verify it now asks for company field when creating journal entries
